# Unit-4-game

Conclusion:
    This asignment taught me how to better use click events and dynamically insert elements with jQuery. All in all I spent about 6hrs on this game. I really wish I was able to attempt the RPG as well, but due to my schedule this past week, I was only able to complete this one. Either way, I feel more comfortable with jQuery, javascript and functions.


Psuedo-Code:

Basic html/css with correct divs.
Create variables.
Get images for my 4 crystals.
Scoreboard to keep track of wins/losses.
Functiom to start game.
    Generate a random number. This is win condition.

Function to add onclick to images.
    Generate random number for each image.
    Each Onclick random image number is added to total number variable.
        if total number === random start game number, results in win.
        if total number > random start game number, results in loss.
    Restart game
